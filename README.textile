h1. Project Overview

http://ror_ecommerce.lighthouseapp.com/home

This is the first Rails e-commerce starter app.  Other e-commerce projects that
use rails, don't use rails in a standard way.  They use engines or are a separate 
framework altogether.  

ROR_ecommerce is designed differently.  ROR_ecommerce is simply a starter application written for 
Rails 3.  If you understand Rails you will understand ROR_ecommerce.  There is nothing 
in this project that you wouldn't see in a normal Rails application.  If you don't like 
what is in the project just change it like you would in any other Rails app.  

Contributors are welcome.  For now email David Henner (drhenner@yahoo.com) to see how you 
can contribute. (send your patch if you have one.)  Soon there will be a bug tracking 
system and a formal way to submit your patch.  

We will always need help with UI, Documentation and code so feel free to help.

h2. Getting Started

We have a google group.  Ask question and help answer questions.
"ror_ecommerce Google-group":http://groups.google.com/group/ror_ecommerce

install rvm with ruby 1.9.2 or if you have 1.9.2 on your system your good to go

Configure your database.yml file (add the development and test database)

*# Go into config/initializers/setting and change the encryption code
*# rake db:migrate
*# rake db:seed
*# rake db:test:prepare
*# git submodule init
*# git submodule update
*# gem install compass
*# gem install fancy-buttons

######compass install -r fancy-buttons -f fancy-buttons


p. Time to start solr and memcache(yep you better install them)
rake sunspot:solr:start

If you decide not to use solr, go into product.rb and delete the following

bc. searchable do
  text    :name, :default_boost => 2
  text      :product_keywords#, :multiple => true
  text      :description
  time      :deleted_at
end

bq. Take a look at setting up solr
    "Solr in 5 minutes":http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot/wiki/adding-sunspot-search-to-rails-in-5-minutes-or-less

bq. memcached -vv  ## you can config many other cache stores but 
                ## the cookie store will not work (in the admin) and the DB session store will be a dog

Need to create config/config.yml and change the encryption key and paypal or auth.net information


Once everything is setup, start up the server and direct it to
*localhost:3000/admin/overviews*

write down the username/password and follow the directions.

h2. TODOs:

* tests
* loyalty credits
* coupons
* product sales (eg. 20% off)
* have breadcrumbs headers by product type and use product_type.parent
* move items from and to saved/wish lists
* remove specific qty from cart.

h2. FYI:

Shipping categories are categories based off price:

you might have two shipping categories (light items) & (heavy items)
